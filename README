First stab at implementing basic prime numbers code in Perl 6. Other than the
fact it remembers the primes which have been calculated so far, nothing fancy.
It's still disturbingly slow.

Usage:


use Math::Prime;

say primes[^10];    # first ten primes
say primes[60];     # the 61st prime
say is-prime(100);  # check if a number is prime

Note that now Perl 6 has is-prime in CORE, this module is quite useless.
